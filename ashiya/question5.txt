5. How to setup multiple remote repositories for the same project ? Explain the use case and you should have a 
working demo of it

Answer:
It is possible to setup multiple remote repositories for the same project.
Having multiple remote repositories for the same project can help in maintaining backups across
different platforms, as well as collaborating with different teams on different platforms.
Steps:
Step-1: Setting up two remote repositories - on GitHub and on GitLab
Step-2: Initialising Git  > git init
Step-3: Adding GitHub and GitLab Remotes 
	> git@github.com:AshiyaAjare/GIT-Advanced-Assignment.git
	> git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/AshiyaAjare/git_advanced.git
Step-4: Verifying the connection withremote repositories
	> git remote -v
Step-5: Commiting the changes:
	> git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step-6: Push to both github and gitlab
	> git push origin-github main
	> git push origin-gitlab main
Step-7: Fetch and pull changes from a specific repository
	> git pull origin-github main
	> git pull origin-gitlab main
