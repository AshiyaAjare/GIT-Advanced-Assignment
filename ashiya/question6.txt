6. How to unstage changes from the staged area, with command ?

Answer:
Staged changes refer to the changes of modifications which are ready to commit. Unstaging files can lead to them 
being untracked. 
Unstaging files refers to removing them from the staged area without loosing their changes.

To unstage a specific file: git restore --staged "file_name"
To unstage all files in the staging area: git restore --staged .
