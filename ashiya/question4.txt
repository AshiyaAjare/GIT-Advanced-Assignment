4. Why is it not possible to create two branches with the names `fix` and `fix/bug` in a Git repository, and 
what causes this conflict?

Answer:
This conflict arises becauses in Git, the slash (/) is treated as a directory separator - to create a hierarchial 
structure. 

When creating the branch 'fix': Git creates a folder named 'fix'

When creating the branch 'fix/bug': It tries to create a folder 'bug' inside a folder named 'fix'. But since 'fix'
already exists (from the branch creation 'fix'), it shows error or conflict.
It shows that a directory and a file, cannot exist in the same naming structure.

To solve this issue, the conflicting branches can be renamed or deleted.

Example:
HP@DESKTOP-58G6OEJ MINGW64 /d/Ashiya/JOSH/INTERNSHIP/GIT Advanced (feature2)
$ git branch fix

HP@DESKTOP-58G6OEJ MINGW64 /d/Ashiya/JOSH/INTERNSHIP/GIT Advanced (feature2)
$ git branch fix/bug
fatal: cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/fix/bug': 'refs/heads/fix' exists; cannot create 'refs/heads/fix/bug'
