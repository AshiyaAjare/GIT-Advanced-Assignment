2. What does the git ls-files command do, and what information does its output provide regarding the state of 
files in a Git repository?

Answer: 
ls-files is a git command used for listing tracked files or the files added in the staging area (ready to commit).
It also helps to identify the untracked files in our git repository.

The ouput of ls-files provides detailed information about the state of files:
git ls-files > shows tracked files
git ls-files --others > outputs untracked files
git ls-files -d > outputs deleted files


Example:
HP@DESKTOP-58G6OEJ MINGW64 /d/Ashiya/JOSH/INTERNSHIP/GIT Advanced (feature2)
$ touch oldFile.txt

HP@DESKTOP-58G6OEJ MINGW64 /d/Ashiya/JOSH/INTERNSHIP/GIT Advanced (feature2)
$ git add "oldFile.txt"

HP@DESKTOP-58G6OEJ MINGW64 /d/Ashiya/JOSH/INTERNSHIP/GIT Advanced (feature2)
$ git status -s
R  file6.txt -> oldFile.txt
